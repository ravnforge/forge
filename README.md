Thanks for stopping by! My name is Samuel, but everyone calls me Raven! I am a Full Stack Web Developer 🚀 from Florida, lived in New York for some time, and now I am enjoying the Pacific Northwest! I'm freelance and go under the developer name 🙍🏽‍♂️ [@RavnForge](https://discord.gg/ZSDTCV6DAf). I'm a creative problem solver, and technology enthusiast, with a constantly growing love for computers, programming, and developing. Beyond all the lines of code and coffee sips, I enjoy getting lost in various games on PC, watching great movies with the family, and getting out of the house (occasionally :P). Feel free to reach out to me, and pehaps we can collaborate on some projects, or geek out together.
